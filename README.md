# What is this ?
A simple data engineering (ETL) project that used python to fetch data from an API (not weatherAPI ðŸ˜‚) in JSON.
Then, extract couple of data from the JSON (also saved as JSON), transformed to a csv then load to a `postgreSQL DB` (in Docker)

Suitable for fresh data engineering bootcamp graduate. 
Surely, you can complicate things by adding `Airflow`, `dbt` and `Snowflake` or even `cloud`.

Shoutout to: @CoreDataEngineer (API is from them!)

## Background Story

A travel agency reached out, their business model involves recommending tourist location to their customers base on different data points, your task is to build an etl that will process data from the Country api into their Database for predictive analytics by their Data Science team.


### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11.5 if you don't know python learn from CS50P [CLICK HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvKCESUCWII&list=PLhQjrBD2T3817j24-GogXmWqO5Q5vYy0V)
